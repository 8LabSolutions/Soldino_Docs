\section{Issues}
We, members of \textit{8Lab solutions}, did our best to build \textit{Soldino} 
bug-free and did extensive tests to squish all of them, but we cannot be sure 
that they are all gone.\\
If you encounter a bug we would appreciate if reported it to us at our 
email address (\href{mailto:8labsolution@gmail.com}{8labsolution@gmail.com}) 
or in the dedicated page at the project's repository (\url{https://github.com/8LabSolutions/Soldino/issues}).
\\When reporting an issue please include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item what type of user encountered it (citizen, business or Government);
	\item a detailed sequence of steps that must be done to reproduce the error;
	\item if the error included Metamask and what type of error it shows;
	\item your browser's console log output.
\end{itemize}
