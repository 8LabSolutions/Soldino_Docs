\section{MetaMask}
	\subsection{What is MetaMask}
	MetaMask is a browser extensions that manages your Ethereum wallet and 
	and allows you to send and receive Ethers (Cubits or CCs in \textit{Soldino}). 
	This plug-in is necessary to perform all the basic actions of an 
	e-commerce such as log in and all transactions. 
	\subsection{Installation}
	After entering \textit{Soldino}'s homepage check if you have MetaMask, a 
	bridge between your browser and the Ethereum network, installed.
	If you don't, watch the video guide, click the link under the video and 
	follow the instructions to download it. After the installation process is 
	complete you will see MetaMask's icon on the top right of your browser. A 
	new window will then open where you will have to configure your account.\\
	The download page can also be found at \url{https://metamask.io/}.

	\noindent After setting up your account you will be able to join and use 
	\textit{Soldino}.
	\newline \\
	Note that MetaMask has to be installed in your browser as long a you want 
	to use the platform, removing it from your browser will render you unable 
	to use \textit{Soldino}.
	\subsection{Transactions}
	Every time you make a transaction MetaMask will open a pop up window that 
	shows you its cost %and the gas needed to make a transaction. 
	From this window you will be able to accept it or decline it.

	Note that all prices shown are in Cubits (CC), \textit{Soldino}'s own 
	special token. Also note that 1 Cubit = 1 Euro.\\
	Every change made on the Ethereum Network has a cost. This is called gas 
	and is measured in GWEI, a billionth of a Ether. When you make a 
	transaction you can choose whether it should have a high or low priority, 
	higher priority will consume more gas than a lower one but will be mined 
	quicker. We do not recommend changing the priority for transaction made 
	in \textit{Soldino} as it does not matter much.\\
