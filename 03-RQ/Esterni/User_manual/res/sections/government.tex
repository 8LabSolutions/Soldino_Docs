	top right of the homepage, you will automatically log in your account 
	(there is no need for a username or password, all is done via MetaMask). 
	\\To be able to log in make sure you are logged in the correct MetaMask\glosp 
	account.

	MetaMask\glosp. To do this you have to press MetaMask's icon on the top 
	right of the browser, press your account's icon and then press "Log out"
