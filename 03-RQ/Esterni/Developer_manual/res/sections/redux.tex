\section{Redux} 
\subsection{Overview}
Redux is a npm module which manage the entire state of the website from client-side. It consists of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Store;
	\item Reducers;
	\item Actions.
\end{itemize}
When the website is built, a default state for the store is set (it is defined into the reducer JavaScript file).
\subsection{Unidirectional pattern} 
Basically some actions are mapped by \textit{container components} into specific \textit{presentational components} through them props with \textit{Connect(arg1, arg2)} method. When a presentational component request a \textit{dispatch()} of a specific action, a reducer will complete the request by changing the store and returning a new instance of the application state. Each time the store is changed, the \textit{Render()} method of displayed components is called.
\textit{Redux} is the name of the pattern implemented by React and Redux, it is an evolution of \textit{Flux} pattern.
\subsection{Redux-Persist}
It is a npm module used for maintaining the current store even if the user leaves the website. It is browser-locally saved, so if a user will enter into the website from another device or from another browser, the store will be set with default values. It has a blacklist for bypassing some values, in this way reloading the website, these values will not be saved (the blacklist is defined into reducer JavaScript file).
