\subsection{Overview}
web3.js is a collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node. Moreover, it is able to communicate with MetaMask, which is the add-on for Chrome and Mozilla Firefox that let the user manage his Ethereum wallet and confirm transactions in an intuitive and secure way. Using MetaMask we offer secure payments and automatic login.
