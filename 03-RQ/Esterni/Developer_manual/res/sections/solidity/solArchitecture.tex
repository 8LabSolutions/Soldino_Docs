\subsection{Architecture overview}
As you know the main feature of the blockchain is its immutability. It means that once a contract is 
deployed, it's not possible to modify or update it. In order to update a contract you need to deploy 
a new contract on the blockchain.\\
In view of this fact and the proponent's request to develop upgradeable smart contracts, the architecture ideated and developed reflects these two aspects. In fact the smarts contracts in Soldino
are essentially of three types:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item\textbf{Storage contract}: this type of contracts aren't upgreadable because they are used
		to save all the critical data like products, orders, vat movements. 
\end{enumerate}
