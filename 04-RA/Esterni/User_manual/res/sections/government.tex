	\subsection{Registration}
	Government's account is only one because it has special privileges that
	they will explain later. For this reason, this account is provided 
	by the developer of \textit{Soldino}.
	\subsection{Login}
	If you want to log in with the government's account press the \texttt{login} button on the 
	top right of the homepage, you will automatically log in your account 
	(there is no need for a username or password, all data are done via MetaMask). 
	\\To be able to log in, make sure you are logged in with the correct MetaMask\glosp 
	account.
	\subsection{Logout}
	To log out of \textit{Soldino}, you just have to log out of 
	MetaMask\glosp. To do this, you have to press MetaMask's icon on the top 
	right of the browser, press your account's icon and then click on \texttt{Log out}
	on the top right.
