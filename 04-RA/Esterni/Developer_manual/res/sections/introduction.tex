\subsection{Purpose of the product}
\textit{Soldino} is a DApp\glosp accessible on a web browser as a 
client interface and the plug-in Metamask is a virtual wallet used for 
transactions made through \textit{Soldino}.\newline
The main functionality of the product is managing VAT but users can also
trade goods and services online. Since the platform's backend\glosp is based on the 
Ethereum\glosp network, it provides more security and transparency than the 
traditional e-commerce websites.\newline
The platform is built to be managed by the government\glosp and the currency used is 
called Cubit\glosp (or CC), a ERC20\glosp compliant fork of Ether minted and managed by 
the government itself.
